## Exercise 1
```{r}
sum(1:1000)
```

## Exercise 2
```{r}
seq(3, 60, by = 3)
```

## Exercise 3
```{r}
min(mtcars$wt)
max(mtcars$wt)
mean(mtcars$wt)
median(mtcars$wt)
```
Or you can use `summary()` to compute all these at once:
```{r}
summary(mtcars$wt)
```

\newpage

## Exercise 4
There is a negative association between the number of cylinders and miles per gallon (mpg).  As the number of cylinders increases, the mpg of the car decreases.
```{r}
plot(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Number of cylinders", ylab = "Miles per gallon")
```

## Exericse 5
The Lotus Europa has the minimum weight.  The Lincoln Continental has the maximum weight.
```{r}
mtcars[which.min(mtcars$wt), ]
mtcars[which.max(mtcars$wt), ]
```

## Exercise 6
```{r}
x <- c(1, 0, FALSE, TRUE)
y <- c(1, 2, "three")
z <- c("TRUE", FALSE)
```
```{r}
x
class(x)
y
class(y)
z
class(z)
```
