\textbf{STAT 630, HW 9}\\
\textbf{Due}: Tues, November 16\\

\textbf{Reading:}  \emph{OpenIntro} Sections 6.3 and 6.4\\ 

\large \textbf{Concept Questions}\\
\normalsize Please refer to lecture 13 notes.\\

\textbf{Exercise 1}. A news article reports that ``Americans have differing views on two potentially inconvenient and invasive practices that airports could implement to uncover potential terrorist attacks." This news piece was based on a survey conducted among a random sample of 1,137 adults nationwide, interviewed by telephone November 7-10, 2010, where one of the questions on the survey was ``Some airports are now using `full-body' digital x-ray machines to electronically screen passengers in airport security lines. Do you think these new x-ray machines should or should not be used at airports?" Below is a summary of responses (answers to this question) based on party affiliation.\footnote{\url{https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-4-in-5-support-full-body-airport-scanners/}} %Exercise 6.32

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|ccc|c} 
\hline
 & Republican & Democrat & Independent & Total\\
\hline
Should    & \boxed{264} & 299 & 351 & 914\\
Should not & 38 & 55 & \boxed{77} & 170\\
Don't know/No answer & 16 & 15    & 22 & 53\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Write the null and alternative hypotheses for a chi-square test of independence between party affiliation and opinion on full-body scans.
\item Assuming independence, calculate the expected counts for the boxed cells. 
\item The test statistic is $\chi^2 = 4.36$.  What is the $p$-value?
\item What is the conclusion of this hypothesis test?  
\item  The conclusion of the test may be incorrect, meaning a testing error was made. If an error was made, was it a Type~I or a Type~II Error?\\
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 2}. Microhabitat factors associated with forage and bed sites of barking deer in Hainan Island, China were examined from 2001 to 2002. In this region woods make up 4.8\% of the land, cultivated grass plot makes up 14.7\%, and deciduous forests makes up 39.6\%. Of the 426 sites where the deer forage, 4 were categorized as woods, 16 as cultivated grassplot, and 61 as deciduous forests. The table below summarizes these data.\footnote{Liwei Teng et al. ``Forage and bed sites characteristics of Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak) in Hainan Island, China". In: \emph{Ecological Research} 19.6 (2004), pp. 675â€“681.}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
Woods & Cultivated grassplot  & Deciduous forests  & Other & Total \\
\hline 
4 & 16  & 61 & 345 & 426 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Conduct a chi-square test of goodness-of-fit to test whether barking deer prefer to forage in certain habitats over others.  Write the null and alternative hypotheses, tabulate the expected counts, report the test statistic and $p$-value, and make a conclusion.  Also discuss whether the conditions for the test are satisfied.

\large \textbf{Data Analysis Questions}\\
\normalsize Please refer to lab 8.\\

The following exercises use the \texttt{GSS2002} data set from the \texttt{resampledata} library.

\textbf{Exercise 3}.  Compute a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of males and females that favor the death penalty.  Interpret the interval.\\

\textbf{Exercise 4}.  Consider the categorical variables \texttt{Education} (highest level of education) and \texttt{SpendMilitary} (position on government spending on military).    
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Make a contingency table between the two variables (the table should have 5 rows and 3 columns).
\item Use \texttt{prop.table()} to make a contingency table of the row proportions (where the rows are the different categories for \texttt{Education}).  Based on the table of row proportions, does there appear to be a relationship between the two categorical variables?
\item Conduct a chi-square test of independence between \texttt{Education} and \texttt{SpendMilitary}.  Write down the null and alternative hypotheses and your conclusion based on the $p$-value.
\item Extract the table of expected counts for the chi-square test you conducted in part (c).  Using this table, are the conditions for the test satisfied?   
\end{enumerate}
